/**
 * \brief This class defines an action to be applied over a packet.
 *        The action will be applied in a specific position [byte], based in the desired rule [type]
 *        but masked using a 64bit [mask].
 *        Besides the [mask] parameter, it's also possible to limit the result of the action using
 *        a user defined range. To do so, configure the parameters [range_first] and [range_last].
 *        Note that these extremes will be valid results.
 *
 *        Once all parameters are defined, the action can be associated with a packet using the
 *        compile method. This will validate the action and save a reference to the packet memory.
 *        After that, every time the apply method is called, the action will be performed updating
 *        the associated packet. The action can no longer be applied once the packet memory is
 *        released (there's no mechanism to prevent that).
 *
 *        There's an special action to re-calculate the IPv4 header checksum. This may be useful
 *        if another action modify any field in the IPv4 header. The target byte must point to
 *        the byte where the checksum starts (byte 24 for untagged IPv4 packets).
 *
 *        It's also possible to create complex actions chaining other actions to this one.
 *        Each action can be chained directly with at most another two actions. One using
 *unconditional
 *        mode and another using periodical mode.
 *
 *        For the first mode, every time this action apply is called, the apply for the
 *unconditionally
 *        bounded action is also called. In the second, the apply of the chained action is called
 *every
 *        [period] applies of this actions. For INCREMENT or DECREMENT actions, there's a special
 *mode
 *        called 'when finished' that chain the other action in periodical mode using the total
 *number
 *        of possible IDs of this action as period.
 *
 *        This is a recursive process: if the chained actions are also chained to other actions,
 *        they will be also called and the process stop when an action is not chained.
 *        In this process, always the "conditional" branch is executed first (if the condition was
 *met).
